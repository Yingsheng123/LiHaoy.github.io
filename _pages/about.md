# üßëüèª‚Äçüéì Biography
I received a B.S. degree in Automation from [Beijing Information Science and Technology University](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/), China, in 2023. I am currently working toward an M.S. degree in Control Engineering at the School of Astronautics, [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin , China.


I'm interested in Robotics, SLAM, 3dgs, 3D Vision, VLM and Embodied AI. Most of my research is about enabling mobile robots sensing intelligently.

- Accurate object perception is essential for robotic applications such as object navigation. In this paper, we propose DQO-MAP, a novel object-SLAM system that seamlessly integrates object pose estimation and reconstruction. We employ 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity object reconstruction and leverage quadrics for precise object pose estimation. Both of them management is handled on the CPU, while optimization is performed on the GPU, significantly improving system efficiency. By associating objects with unique IDs, our system enables rapid object extraction from the scene.

- In this paper we introduce MLINE-VINS, a novel monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system that leverages line features and Manhattan Word assumption. Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization

Consensus control of unknown nonlinear discrete-time multi-agent systems with nonuniform time-delays. 

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This project investigates the data-driven consensus control for a class of unknown heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent systems with non-uniform communication delay by using model free adaptive control (MFAC) method. The designed controller is distributed and data-driven with only using the agent itself and its neighbors data information without any model information.
