# 🧑🏻‍🎓 Biography
I received a B.S. degree in Automation from [Beijing Information Science and Technology University](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/), China, in 2023. I am currently working toward an M.S. degree in Control Engineering at the School of Astronautics, [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin , China.


I'm interested in Robotics, SLAM, 3dgs, 3D Vision and Embodied AI. Most of my research is about enabling mobile robots sensing intelligently.

 [//]: # (I was the recipient of the National Scholarship for Postgraduate at Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2024 and hold 5 Chinese invention patents.)
 
 [//]: # (My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).)

Consensus control of unknown nonlinear discrete-time multi-agent systems with nonuniform time-delays. 

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This project investigates the data-driven consensus control for a class of unknown heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent systems with non-uniform communication delay by using model free adaptive control (MFAC) method. The designed controller is distributed and data-driven with only using the agent itself and its neighbors data information without any model information.
